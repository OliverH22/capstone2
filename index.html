            <h2>WHY PLASTIC POLLUTION?</h2>
            <p>Plastic pollution in our oceans is one of the Earth's greatest environmental threats.</p>

            <p>By getting a better understanding of pollution, we can help put an end to it.</p>

            <h2>QUANTITY</h2>
            <h3>How much plastic is in the ocean?</h3>
            <p>Short answer? Lots. Humans have been dumping plastics in the ocean at a rate of about 8 million tons per year.</p>
            <p>This plastic comes in different forms, ranging from tiny particles called microplastics, up to larger pieces like bottles and packages.</p>

            <h2>The Source</h2>
            <h3>Where do ocean plastics come from?</h3>
            <p>Ocean pollution comes from a lot of different places, but not as much as you might think.</p>
            <p>While some plastic pollution comes from individuals throwing garbage out, the majority is actually from big corporations disposing of waste.</p>
            <p>Believe it or not, 90% of the ocean plastic comes from the same 10 rivers.</p>

            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <h3>The dangers of ocean microplastics</h3>
            <p>Though large plastics are the obvious threat, microplastics are incredibly harmful too.</p>
            <p>Fish and other marine life often eat these tiny plastic particles, which can be harmful and potentially toxic to animals.</p>
            <p>Plastic ingested by fish breaks down into potentially toxic fibers, which make their way up the food chain - even to humans.</p>
