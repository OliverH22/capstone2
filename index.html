            <h3>HOW MUCH PLASTIC IS IN THE OCEAN?</h3>
            <p class="pW">Short answer? Lots. Humans have been dumping plastics in the ocean at a rate of about 8 million tons per year.</p>
            <p class="pW">This plastic comes in different forms, ranging from tiny particles called microplastics, up to larger pieces like bottles and packages.</p>

            <p class="pW">The amount of plastic in the ocean has grown exponentially since 1950, and will continue to grow unless we act now.</p>

            <h2 id="cHeadingB">THE SOURCE</h2>
            <h3>WHERE DO OCEAN PLASTICS COME FROM?</h3>
            <p class="pB">Ocean pollution comes from a lot of different places, but not as much as you might think.</p>
            <p class="pB">While some plastic pollution comes from individuals throwing garbage out, the majority is actually from big corporations disposing of waste.</p>
            <p class="pB">Believe it or not, 90% of the ocean plastic comes from the same 10 rivers.</p>
            <img src="img/graph2.JPG" alt="river pollution">
            <p class="pB">Whatâ€™s important to understand here is that the only way to create real change is to hold  corporations accountable. The best way to do that is by supporting ocean-friendly policies and regulations.</p>

            <h2 id="cHeadingW">EFFECTS</h2>
            <h3>THE DANGERS OF OCEAN MICRO PLASTICS</h3>
            <p class="pW">Though large plastics are the obvious threat, microplastics are incredibly harmful too.</p>
            <p class="pW">Fish and other marine life often eat these tiny plastic particles, which can be harmful and potentially toxic to animals.</p>
            <p class="pW">Plastic ingested by fish breaks down into potentially toxic fibers, which make their way up the food chain - even to humans.</p>
