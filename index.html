                <h3 id="sub1Heading">HOW MUCH PLASTIC IS IN THE OCEAN?</h3>
                <p class="pQ">Short answer? Lots. Humans have been dumping plastics in the ocean at a rate of about 8 million tons per year.</p>
                <p class="pQ">This plastic comes in different forms, ranging from tiny particles called microplastics, up to larger pieces like bottles and packages.</p>
                <p class="pQ">The amount of plastic in the ocean has grown exponentially since 1950, and will continue to grow unless we act now.</p>

                <p class="pS">While some plastic pollution comes from individuals throwing garbage out, the majority is actully from big corporations disposing of waste. </p>
                <p class="pS">Believe it or not, most of the world's plastic pollution comes from just a few regions.</p>
                <p class="pS">What's importahnd to understand here is that the only way to create real change is to hold corporations accountable. The best way to do that is by supporting ocean-friendly policies and regulations.</p>
